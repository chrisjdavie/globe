{"name":"Globe","tagline":"A novel globe visualisation of geographical data","body":"# Globe visualisation\r\n\r\n>An interactive globe visualisation of geodemographic data would be awesome, novel and engaging.  And a striking demo of our technical ability.  And wouldn't take too long to complete.\r\n\r\nThis was, more or less, my pitch to my boss.  And now I'm making open source globes for data visualisation. In between everything else I'm doing.\r\n\r\n# Customer\r\n\r\nThe ASI runs a data science training course, an intensive eight week post-doctoral fellowship enabling\r\nscientists to become data scientists and engineers.  It also does corporate training and technical consulatancy.  \r\n\r\n# Challenge\r\n\r\nWhile the ASI have undertaken and completed a number of pretty complicated projects, as they're commercially sensitive, they don't lend themselves to online tech demos.  It would be good to have something on our website that demonstrated our technical ability, along with our ability to come up with engaging visualisations and our ability to generate novel solutions.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nI hadn't seen an interactive globe-based choropleth (coloured in map polygons), and as this should be a straightforward implimentation using d3, I suggested we build one.  Combining this with public data such as GDP, Ebola infections and Electricity use, we could construct a quite compelling visualisation as part of a dashboard, which would be interesting, useful and a demostration of what we can do at the ASI.\r\n\r\n# Results\r\n\r\nWell, hopefully will be here when I've finished them.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
